# Personal Diary Management System (C)

A menu-driven **Personal Diary Management System** implemented in **C**, designed to demonstrate the practical use of **Data Structures and Algorithms**.

This project allows users to securely maintain diary entries with features such as add, update, delete, search, sort, and undo operations. It is built as part of my DSA learning journey and focuses on correctness, clarity, and real-world applicability.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Personal Diary System helps users:
- Store daily diary entries with dates
- Search entries efficiently
- Maintain entries in sorted order
- Undo recent actions
- Protect access using a password

The project uses **linked lists, stacks, and sorting algorithms**, making it a strong example of applying DSA concepts in C.

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 Password-protected access
- ➕ Add new diary entries
- 👀 View all diary entries
- ✏️ Update existing entries
- ❌ Delete entries
- 🔍 Search entries by keyword
- 📅 Search entries within a date range
- 📊 Sort diary entries by date (Merge Sort)
- ↩️ Undo last action (using Stack)
- 🕒 Displays date and content clearly

---

## 🛠️ Data Structures Used

- **Singly Linked List** – to store diary entries dynamically  
- **Stack** – to implement undo functionality  
- **Merge Sort** – to sort entries by date

## ⚙️ How to Compile and Run

### Requirements
- C Compiler (GCC recommended)
- Any C IDE (Dev-C++, VS Code, Code::Blocks, or terminal)

### Steps
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open a terminal in the project folder
3. Compile the program:
gcc diary.c -o diary
4. Run the program:
./diary


> ℹ️ Note: The program was originally written and tested using **Dev-C++**, but it works with GCC as well.
